# SliceFrenzy-Webcam-Warrior
## Unleash your inner ninja: slice, dice, and master the art of motion in a thrilling fruit-chopping frenzy!

### To play:
first clone the repo to your local machine (note: currently the game is not optimized so it might not run smoothly on lower-end devices) 

In the folder directory install required packages with:
``` 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

and then:
```
Python src/main.py
```

# The first time you load the game may take a lot of time as it needs to load the movenet model
